Raze is a source port, powered by GZDoom tech, for playing classic Build Engine games like Duke Nukem 3D.

The following games are officially supported, and should be placed in the designated directory with their required
files (including subdirectories):
  * blood:          Blood (movies/*.ogv, blood.ini, *.art, *.dat, *.rff)
  * blood:          Blood: Cryptic Passage (see instructions further below)
  * duke:           Duke Nukem 3D (DUKE3D.GRP)
  * duke:           Duke Nukem 3D: Duke It Out in D.C. (DUKEDC.GRP)

  * ww2gi:          World War II GI: Platoon Leader (PLATOONL.DAT, PLATOONL.DEF)

For some of these expansion packs, the required files (including subdirectories) need to be collected into the root
of a .zip file and placed in the designated directory:

  Blood: Cryptic Passage
    1. Collect required files: movies/*.ogv, *.art, *.ini, *.map
    2. Zip required files into root of cryptic.zip
    3. Place cryptic.zip in blood directory

  Redneck Rampage: Suckin' Grits on Route 66
    1. Collect ANM files: END66.ANM, TURD66.ANM
    2. Collect ART files: TILESA66.ART, TILESB66.ART
    3. Collect CON files: BUBBA66.CON, DEFS66.CON, GAME66.CON, GATOR66.CON, PIG66.CON, USER66.CON
    4. Collect MAP files: ROUTE66/*.MAP (keep the ROUTE66 subdirectory)
    5. Collect VOC files: ASYAMB.VOC, END66.VOC, G_BITE.VOC, G_SIT.VOC, NEON.VOC, TURD66.VOC
    6. Rename files: TILESA66.ART -> TILES024.ART; TILESB66.ART -> TILES025.ART; GAME66.CON -> GAME.CON
    7. Zip required files into root of route66.zip
    8. Place route66.zip in redneck directory

Optionally, add music tracks with the following names to the designated directories:
  * blood:          track02.ogg or blood02.ogg, etc.
  * exhumed:        track02.ogg or exhumed02.ogg, etc.
  * redneck:        track02.ogg or redneck02.ogg, etc.
  * redneckrides:   track02.ogg or redneckrides02.ogg, etc.
  * shadow:         track02.ogg or shadow02.ogg, etc.

Each game needs a .raze file. The purpose of this file is to tell Raze how to launch the game. This is simple
for most cases but can be more complicated if you are installing mods. It is recommended to underscore the name so
the scraper has an easier time getting a match e.g. Duke_Nukem_3D.raze.

For Blood, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE = /blood/BLOOD.RFF

For Blood: Cryptic Passage, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE  = /blood/BLOOD.RFF
  FILE+ = /blood/cryptic.zip

For each Duke Nukem 3D game, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE  = /duke/DUKE3D.GRP
  FILE+ = /duke/DUKEDC.GRP  <-- Note: Omit this line for the base game, update filename for each expansion

For Exhumed/PowerSlave, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE = /exhumed/STUFF.DAT

For Nam, create an .raze file with the following text:
  FILE = /nam/NAM.GRP
  CON  = /nam/NAM.CON

For Redneck Rampage, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE = /redneck/REDNECK.GRP

For Redneck Rampage: Suckin' Grits on Route 66, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE  = /redneck/REDNECK.GRP
  FILE+ = /redneck/route66.zip

For Redneck Rampage Rides Again, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE = /redneckrides/RIDES.GRP

For each Shadow Warrior game, create a .raze file with the following text:
  FILE  = /shadow/SW.GRP
  FILE+ = /shadow/TD.GRP  <-- Note: Omit this line for the base game, update filename for each expansion

For World War II GI, create an .raze file with the following text:
  FILE = /ww2gi/WW2GI.GRP

For the World War II GI: Platoon Leader expansion, create an .raze file with the following text:
  FILE  = /ww2gi/WW2GI.GRP
  FILE+ = /ww2gi/PLATOONL.DAT
  CON   = PLATOONL.DEF
