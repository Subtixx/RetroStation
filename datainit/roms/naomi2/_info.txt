## NAOMI 2 IMPORTANT INFO ##
---------------------------------

You can now play limited Naomi 2 games using the Flycast emulators.
Roms should be stored in the appropriate naomi2 directory.
You will need a Naomi 2 bios, please add the naomi2.zip file to your bios/dc directory.

--------------------------------
## DEMUL - CURRENTLY DISABLED ##
--------------------------------

An alternative is to use Demul with Wine.
Note: Your graphics card requires Vulkan drivers for Demul to work.

Performance depends on your x86_64 system hardware.
If you get audio stuttering & slow music, your system isn't performant enough to run this emulator.

-----------
First Start
-----------

You need to run a ROM at least once AND be connected to the internet.
This creates the directory structure & installs the associated Windows libraries for Wine.

Note: It may take some time before the game starts with the first use, this is NORMAL!
*** Please be patient as it can take up to 2 minutes depending on your internet connection speed ***

-----------
Controllers
-----------

Currently controllers cannot be configured using the desktop app.
This is a limitation of the Demul app under Wine but also a known buggy pad plugin, even under Windows.
Currently we only map Player 1 using the emulators default keyboard configuration using evmapy.

Note: Future consideration:

Demul uses decimal for pad configuration in the padDemul.ini
To determine the decimal we have to convert the hexadecimal to decimal.
You can edit arcade controls they're under the [JAMMAx_x] headings depending on the number of controllers.

Controller 1 = 0x100 & 0x200 for the buttons & the 2x analog sticks.
Controller 2 = 0x101 & 0x201 etc.

Device input hex codes are listed in the appropriate linux kernel input.h depending on the controller type.
i.e. A gamepad's 'start' button is 0x13b
Therefore controller 1's start button is 0100013b in hex or 16777531 in decimal.
Controller 2 would be 0101013b / 16843067 accordingly.

------------
Service Menu
------------

Note: Keyboard required.
You can access the Service Menu using F4 and then use F2 to navigate with F4 to select.

Enjoy Naomi 2 games under Linux!
